Typeable: A Python library for schema modeling, validation and conversion
=========================================================================

Typeable will provide a working implementation of `typing.cast`. In addition, 
we plan to provide various features and extensions based on this. The code is 
currently in the proof-of-concept phase.

Typeable requires Python 3.6+. And it doesn't require any other dependencies.
