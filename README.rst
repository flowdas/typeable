Typeable: A Python type casting at runtime
==========================================

Cast a value to a type.

Typeable will provide a working implementation of ``typing.cast``. In addition, 
we plan to provide various features and extensions based on this. The code is 
currently in the proof-of-concept phase.

Typeable requires Python 3.6+. And it doesn't require any other dependencies.
