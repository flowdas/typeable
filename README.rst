Typeable: A Python type casting at runtime
==========================================

Cast a value to a type.

Typeable provides an extensible runtime implementation of ``typing.cast``. 
In addition, we plan to provide various features and extensions based on this.
For example, input validation, data conversion, serialization, schematic 
assertion and structural transformation can all be viewed as type casting.

The code is currently at the alpha stage. Although ``typeable.cast`` 
understands and casts generic types, it is still lacking in consistency and 
completeness.

Your criticism and participation are always welcome.

Typeable requires Python 3.7+.
